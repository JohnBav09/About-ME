<p>I've been on Youtube for 6 years now, No im not some bigshot youtuber by any means but i have done some pretty cool stuff,
    I do gaming content, and came up with a consept that no one has used before which is really cool!
    I enjoy pokemon I do nuzlockes for youtube so here are my MVP's, and I have gotten into Dark souls as well! you will see the 5 bosses i had the most trouble with in my blind run 
    Note: My blind run is not over so this list is subject to change.

        <h1>Pokemon Nuzlocke (YouTube) MVP's</h1>
        <h2>Pokemon Leaf Green Randomizer Nuzlocke</h2>
<u1><b>Sunflora</b></u1>
<img Id="LGRN" src="LGRN.png">
<p> In my randomizers I like to have random movesets, what made this Pokemon So good is it had giga drain, sacredfire, so it was 
    able to burn people on a dime, and recover health by itself while it was at it! It was keeping everything around it alive. </p>
    
    <h2>Pokemon Black Randomizer Nuzlocke</h2>
    <u1><b>Probopass</b></u1>
    <img Id="BRN" src="BRN.png">
    <p> This was the hard wall in the series it only died becase a peliper got a hydrocannon crit... </p>
    
        <h2>Pokemon Ultra Moon Randomizer Nuzlocke</h2>
        <u1><b>Beartic</b></u1>
        <img Id="UMRN" src="UMRN.png">
        <p>I caught this at the beginning, and then it had many moments that it should have never servived. It servived attacks from an 
            Ultra Necrozma, it also servived attacks from primal groudon!!!
        </p>
    
            <h2>Pokemon Firered Randomizer Sleeplocke</h2>
            <u1><b>Salamence</b></u1>
            <img Id="FRSL" src="FRSL.png">
            <p> It was an amazing set up sweeper! gotta to love the fact that i had this amazing starter, i had fun getting this as a started 
                it died just about when i stopped the series cause a sleeplocke is where you play the game in one session, which i learned is not
            my thing </p>
    
                <h2>Pokemon Sapphire Extreme Randomizer nuzlocke</h2>

                <p> He was very frail but carried when he needed to be on there. Winonna ended up killing him by conceling Hydro cannon!</p> </p>
